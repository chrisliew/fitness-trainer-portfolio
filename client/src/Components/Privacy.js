      <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
      <p>
        The following Privacy Policy governs the online information collection
        practices of www.fitnesstrainergains.com (“we” or “us” or “Site”). By
        visiting and using the Site, you agree that your use of our Site, and
        any dispute over privacy, is governed by this Privacy Policy.
        <br />
        <br />
        This Site strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet
        technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience. We
        may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name and/or e-mail
        address) subject to the terms of this privacy policy.
        <br />
        <br />
        We may collect and store personal or other information that you
        voluntarily supply to us online while using the Site (e.g., while on the
        Site or in responding via email to a feature provided on the Site). This
        Site only contacts individuals who specifically request that we do so or
        in the event that they have signed up to one of our products.
        <br />
        <br />
        This Site collects personally identifying information from our users
        during online registration and online purchasing. All of this
        information is provided to us by you.
        <br />
        <br />
        We also collect and store information that is generated automatically as
        you navigate online through the Site. For example, we may collect
        information about your computer’s connection to the Internet, which
        allows us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our web pages
        to you and to measure traffic on the Site. We also may use a standard
        feature found in browser software called a “cookie” to enhance your
        experience with the Site.
        <br />
        <br />
        When you access another website or purchase third-party products or
        services through the Site, use of any information you provide is
        governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are
        visiting or the provider of such products or services.
        <br />
        <br />
        We may also make some content, products and services available through
        our Site through cooperative relationships with third-party providers,
        where the brands of our provider partner appear on the Site in
        connection with such content, products and/or services.
        <br />
        <br />
        We may share with our provider partner any information you provide, or
        that is collected, in the course of visiting any pages that are made
        available in cooperation with our provider partner. In some cases, the
        provider partner may collect information from you directly, in which
        cases the privacy policy of our provider partner may apply to the
        provider partner’s use of your information.
        <br />
        <br />
        The privacy policy of our provider partners may differ from ours. If you
        have any questions regarding the privacy policy of one of our provider
        partners, you should contact the provider partner directly for more
        information.
